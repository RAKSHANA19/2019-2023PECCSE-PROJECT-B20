# Project Description
This project was done using ML . 
In this project, we predict the stock market price utilising real time data as input and the trained model would display the result. 
We trained the model with four different algorithms like Random forest, Decision tree algorithm, Linear Regression. 
The maximum accuracy percentage obtained was 99.9 from Linear Regression algorithm which we used to deploy the model. 
We have did this project in the form of a web page where we have used Flask framework to integrate our model and website.
